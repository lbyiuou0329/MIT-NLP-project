jupyter notebook on server

On server:
screen -S session_name
<ctrl D+A> to detach
<screen -r> to reattach
<screen -ls> to list all sessions

In screen session, type
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888
write down token

on local machine
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8890:localhost:8888 <remote_user_name>@<remote_server_ip>
(first localhost is your local machine and port you wanna use, second local host points to the port you used on remote server)
then type in password

open in your browser:
localhost:8890/

Done!

more advanced:
Helper function to fire-up a Jupyter notebook in remote

function jpt(){
    # Fires-up a Jupyter notebook by supplying a specific port
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=$1
}
And thus I only need to write:

remoteuser@remotehost: jpt 8889
Helper function to listen to a port

function jptt(){
    # Forwards port $1 into port $2 and listens to it
    ssh -N -f -L localhost:$2:localhost:$1 remoteuser@remotehost
}
And so:

localuser@localhost: jptt 8889 8888
